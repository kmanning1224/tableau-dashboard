# Findings w/ Citi Bike Data

I wanted to explore whether Bike ID, Gender, and location affected trip avg.

I discovered in my analysis that each Bike ID is affected by gender and location with its usage.
The top 5 ID's showed that certain Genders preferred a specific Bike ID over others heavily. 
This could be affected by location of stations and the demographic of the area. \
Moving forward, I wanted to compare usage by age and gender. The largest area was the Unknown category, and while
this data could of been dropped to focus only on genders provided I felt that it was important to show this category due to
the amount of Age gap that seemed to exist between the genders stated and the ones uncomfirmed. As you can see in my second dashboard, year of birth to gender shows where each gender spiked in usage based off of age. It seems that Female users increased
heavily amongst users born in 2000. Male users seem to maintain a steady up and down tick. The unknown class peaks with users born around 1980. Moving forward in my final dashboard, I wanted to examine trip diration vs Starting stations. I found it interesting that the two highest trip duration avgs were rather close together, yet there were multiple stations near by that did not average nearly as much. This could be due to ease of access, or even attractions near these stations. More data would be needed to find out whether this could be affecting these numbers.
